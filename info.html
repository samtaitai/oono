          <h2>The history of UNO</h2>
          <p>
            <em>UNO</em> was created in <time datetime="1971">1971</time> by a
            guy named Merle Robbins. He ran a barber shop in a small town in
            Ohio but besides of his day job, he was a great enthusiasts of card
            games. Not only Merle Robbins himself, but his entire family were
            greatly into playing cards. One day, Robbins and his son had a
            dispute over a rule of card game called
            <em
              ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights"
                >'Crazy Eights'</a
              ></em
            >. Not like any other father, a huge geek Robbins tried to resolve a
            disagreement by creating a new card game by himself. The very first
            <em>UNO</em> cards were made on Robbins family dining room table by
            hand, which is a humble origin story of <em>UNO</em>!

            At first, <em>UNO</em> was simply for Robbins family to enjoy but it
            became clear to Robbins family that the game had major potential.
            Robbins family started sell <em>UNO</em> games at the barber shop
            and soon, the popularity of the game became obvious. With a great
            deal of faith in the creation, the family sold out the barbershop,
            even their house to finance to manufacture the first
            <data value="5000">5,000</data> games of <em>UNO</em>. bought a
            camping trailer and traveled Ohio, Texas, Florida to promote the
            card game and educate people. They successfully sold 5,000 copies
            and got enough funds to produce another
            <data value="10000">10,000</data> copies of the game. The business
            was growing further and it was only matter of time the opportunity

          <h2>How to play UNO</h2>
          <h3>
            The goal of the game is to be the first player who discards all of
            cards in your hands!
          </h3>
          <h3>
            <span id="highlight">In a UNO deck, we have:</span>
          </h3>
          <ul id="components">
            <li>
              <strong>19 Blue, Green, Red, Yellow cards</strong> for each colors
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>8 skip cards:</strong> when you play this card, the next
              person lose his/her chance to discard a card!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>8 reverse cards:</strong> this card reverses direction of
              play.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>8 draw 2 cards:</strong> when you play this card, the next
              person should draw 2 cards in his/her turn!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4 draw 4 cards:</strong> now the next person should draw 4

            <li>
              <strong>4 wild cards:</strong> when you play this card, you can

          <h3>
            <span id="highlight">How to set up?</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each player draws a card, the player with the highest point card is
            the dealer. The dealer shuffles a deck, and each player has 7 cards
            at the beginning. Place the remaining cards facedown to form a draw
            pile. Turn over a top card of the pile to begin a discard pile.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <span id="highlight">How to play?</span>
          </h3>
          <ol id="rules">
            <li>
              Player to the left of the dealer starts first. Match the top card
              on the discard pile either by number, color, or word. If you don't
              have anything that matches, you must pick a card from the draw
              pile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before you play your last card,
              <strong>you must say “UNO”</strong>. If you don't say it or
              another player catches you, you must pick 4 more cards from the
              draw pile as a penalty. When the victory is on the horizon, you'd
              better be sneaky!
            </li>
            <li>
              If no one is out of cards by the time the draw pile is depleted,
              reshuffle the discard pile and continue play.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Once a player has played all of cards and hands empty, he/she wins
            the game and the round is over. In order to rank the others, points
            are calculated based upon the remaining cards that are in the hands
            of other players.

            <span id="highlight">Pay attention to your opponents</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Make others gaining cards by all means! Always count the number of
            cards of your opponents. When a player has a lot of cards and but he
            still changes to a certain color, be careful! He is soon about to
            get rid of tons of cards. Similar, when your opponent has to keep
            drawing cards on a color, stick to the current color; don't let them
            get that chance!
          </p>
          <h3>
            <span id="highlight">Keep +2 and +4 for emergencies</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Keep the blows until the right time! If you play them too early, you
            have nothing left in case of an emergency later. When you see
            players having two or fewer cards, it's for sure time to use these
            cards.

            <span id="highlight">Avoid someone from going out</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            If some player is down to one card, you need to do whatever you can
            to stop him/her. Use action card like +2 or +4, reverse the play
            order, change the color, at all costs! Check also if people forget
            to say Uno when they have one. Make sure they get the sweet penalty
            they deserve.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <span id="highlight">Quickly get rid of matched numbers</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            For instance, if you have a yellow 4, a green 4, and a red 4, get
            rid of at least 2 of them. Do not make your hands heavy with
            repetitive cards.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <span id="highlight">Play series of similar color cards first</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Select all the same color cards in your hand so that you prevent the
            next player from having a turn and playing them first. Use your draw
            2 card, skip card, or reverse card in a row. You might lose your
            best friend by doing this, but it will increase your chances of
            winning anyway!
